10000 sessions of the form {:user_id 27 :session_id "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"}

MRI:
  Marshal: 0.249567031860352
  Base64: 0.146347045898438
  Both: 0.37

Clojure:
  prn-str: 0.25
  read-string: 0.22
  base64: .38
  All: 0.85

Not good, but at 200 req/second its about 5% of request time.
Could probably be made 2-10 times faster with a simple Java extension.
Workable for now though
